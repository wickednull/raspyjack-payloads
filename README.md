# raspyjack-payloads
 Just a repo where I keep my custom RaspyJack payloads. Got a little bit of    everything—network tools, wireless attacks, Trying to figure out HID attacks lol, and  phishing pages for testing.    Heads up: This is all for education and testing on your own gear.    Don't be a jerk with it.
